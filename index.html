        <h1>Hi!</h1>Tony Stark 
	    <div class="line"></div>Tony Stark is a classic American Romantic Hero because he fits the criteria. According to our notes, the Romantic Hero character traits include being emotional, which he shows emotion when he says to his assistant after she claims to never want to replace his heart again, that she is the only one he has.He experienced a severe chest injury when he was kidnapped. His kidnappers were forcing him to come up with a destructive weapon. Rather than creating the weapon, Tony Stark develops a powered suit of armor for the purpose of saving his life and escaping captivity.
        <p>.<br><br>.The records state that at the age of 15, Tony joined MIT and by 19, he had completed two master's degrees in engineering. There are also some claims that he received doctorates in physics and artificial intelligence. It's as if Tony Stark has suits for almost every type of mission.I believe Tony revealed himself as being Iron Man because him being the cocky “always right” guy he is, he craved the credit he would receive if people knew he was Iron Man. Tony knew exactly what to do to improve and better not only the world but himself, but he wanted people to know that all of it is from him.</p>
